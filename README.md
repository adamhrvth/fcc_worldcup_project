# PostgreSQL and Bash scripting project: World Cup database
#### FreeCodeCamp's relational database certification project (www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-world-cup-database-project/build-a-world-cup-database).
This is my solution for FCC's relational database project. The task was to create a database, insert data in it from a .csv file about previous football World Cup results, and query some useful information using Bash and PostgreSQL.
